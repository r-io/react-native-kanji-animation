$ npm install react-native-kanji-animation --save

# using yarn
$ yarn add react-native-kanji-animation
```

### Usage  

```javascript
import { Kanji } from 'react-native-kanji-animation';

render() {
  return (
    <Kanji
      ref={el => kanjiExample = el}
      element="å„€"
      size={90}
      placeholder={true}
      duration={300}
      step={10}
      onPress={() => kanjiExample.animate()}
    />
  );
}
```

#### Methods

##### animate(animationEndCallback?)
Starts the kanji stroke animation with an optional callback after the animation ends.

Example:
```javascript
this.kanji.animate(() => console.log("animation finished"));
```

##### numOfStrokes()
Return `number`. Obtain the total number of stroke of the current kanji element.

Example:
```javascript
console.log(this.kanji.numOfStrokes());
```

##### strokeProperties()
Return `Array of SVGPathProperties`. Obtain the SVG Path Properties for each stroke with the following methods:

-  getTotalLength: () => number;
-  getPointAtLength: (fractionLength: number) => Point;
-  getTangentAtLength: (fractionLength: number) => Point;
-  getPropertiesAtLength: (fractionLength: number) => import("./types").PointProperties;
-  getParts: () => PartProperties[];

Example:
```javascript
console.log(this.kanji.strokeProperties()[0].getTotalLength());
```
